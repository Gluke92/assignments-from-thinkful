1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

--we need to look for the longest trip, specifically where the status is rainy. -> We're going to have to combine the trips and weather tables.
--1) Make "rain CTE" out of weathers table by "rain" status
 --2) Find 
 
 
 
 WITH
    rainy_days
AS (
    SELECT
    *
FROM 
    weather
WHERE 
	weather.events = 'Rain'
    GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT *
 FROM
  rainy_days r 
  
JOIN
  trips t

ON
 t.start_date = r.date
 
 ORDER BY duration DESC
  
 LIMIT 3
 
---
 WITH
    rainy_days
AS (
    SELECT
    *
FROM 
    weather
WHERE 
	weather.events = 'Rain'
)

SELECT 
	t.duration
 FROM
  rainy_days r 
 JOIN
	trips t
ON 
	r.date = t.start_date
  
  --Answer---
  WITH
    rainy_days
AS (
    SELECT
	DATE(date) rain_date
FROM 
    weather
WHERE 
	events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT 
	t.trip_id,
	t.duration,
	DATE(t.start_date)
 FROM
  rainy_days r 
 JOIN
	trips t
ON 
	DATE(t.start_date) = r.rain_date
ORDER BY
	duration DESC
LIMIT 3

2. Which station is full most often?
  
SELECT t.start_station, (t.end_terminal - t.start_terminal) fullness
FROM trips t
ORDER BY fullness DESC
LIMIT 20

'San Jose Diridian Caltrain'
---Answer-----
SELECT
status.station_id,
stations.name,
COUNT(CASE WHEN docks_available=0 then 1 END) empty_count
FROM status
JOIN stations
on stations.station_id = status.station_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY empty_count DESC

3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
  
SELECT start_station, dockcount, COUNT(*) 
FROM trips t JOIN stations s ON s.name = t.start_station
GROUP BY t.start_station, s.dockcount
ORDER BY s.dockcount DESC

---Answer----
SELECT
start_station,
dockcount,
COUNT(*)
FROM trips
JOIN stations
ON stations.name=trips.start_station
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC

4. What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?

1) filter to rainy days
2) get longest trip for those days
3) filter by length

WITH rainy AS 
(
SELECT *
FROM weather
WHERE events='Rain'
)

SELECT max(trips.duration)
FROM rainy JOIN trips ON DATE(trips.start_date) = DATE(rainy.date)

---Answer ---

WITH rainy as 
(
SELECT 
DATE(date) weather_date
From weather
WHERE events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY 1
),
rain_trips as (
SELECT
trip_id,
duration,
DATE(trips.start_date) rain_trips_date
FROM trips
JOIN rainy
on rainy.weather_date = DATE(trips.start_date)
ORDER BY duration DESC
)
SELECT 
rain_trips_date,
max(duration) max_duration
from rain_trips
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY max_duration DESC
