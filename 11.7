---Exploring air_bnb data

1. What's the most expensive listing? What other information can you get?

SELECT
	*
FROM 
	sfo_listings
WHERE price = 10000

--Notes: most expensive is running at 10,000. I used a general query and an ORDER BY price DESC to get the highest price.
--I also explored joining the sfo_calendar and the sfo_listings groups by their id's, and discovered that the text data
--in calendar for price is the same as the "real" data in sfo_listings. 

SELECT
	*
FROM 
	sfo_listings
WHERE price > 500
ORDER BY price desc

---found that the prices in the top 6-7 are between 4k and 10k. They're all whole-houses. 


2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

West of Twin Peaks
Western Addition
Visiticon 


---Queries for neighbourhoods 

SELECT
	neighbourhood,
	neighbourhood_group,
	number_of_reviews,
	reviews_per_month,
	availability_365,
	last_review,
	price
FROM 
	sfo_listings
WHERE price > 1000 
ORDER BY neighbourhood desc

--
SELECT
	neighbourhood,
	neighbourhood_group,
	number_of_reviews,
	reviews_per_month,
	availability_365,
	last_review,
	price
FROM 
	sfo_listings
WHERE price > 0 
ORDER BY neighbourhood desc


3. What time of year is the cheapest time to go to San Francisco? What about the busiest?

SELECT 
	DATE(last_review) review,
	price
FROM 
	sfo_listings
WHERE 
	price < 500
ORDER BY review asc

--Not sure how to do this. This could be a good thing to investigate with Alan.
