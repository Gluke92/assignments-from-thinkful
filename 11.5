Thinkful

--1. What was the hottest day in the set? Where was that?

--"-est" indicates a MAX aggregator. We need to return a table with the max_temperature, and with the location. I see
--a zipcode (location) variable called "zip," and a max_temperaure varaible called "MaxTemperatureF."

SELECT 
	Zip,
	MAX(MaxTemperatureF) as max_temperature
FROM
	weather
GROUP BY 
	zip
  
  --2. How many trips started at each station?
  
  --I want to aim at the number of trips started, and return a list grouped by station.
  
  SELECT 
	station_id as station_id,
	dockcount as number_of_trips
FROM
	stations
ORDER BY 
	dockcount
  
  --3. What's the shortest trip that happened?
  
  SELECT
   MIN(duration) 
   FROM
   trips
   
   ---4. What's the average duration of trips, by end station? 
   
   SELECT 
	AVG(duration),
	end_station
FROM trips
GROUP BY
	end_station
